# Answering Business Questions of a Digital Store using SQL

## Introduction

In this project, we use the `Chinook` database. It represents a fictional digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.

We use SQL run on a Jupyter Notebook to analyze the data.

- Data: [chinook.db](https://github.com/bertacv/chinook-digital-store/blob/main/data/chinook.db)
- Notebook: [Chinook-Business-Questions](https://github.com/bertacv/chinook-digital-store/blob/main/notebooks/Chinook-Business-Questions.ipynb)

That is a project of the Dataquest learning program.

## Outline

This project consists of doing a business analysis of the Chinook digital media store by answering the following questions:

- Which new albums should we add to the store?
- How is the Sales Support Agents performance?
- How are the sales in each country? Does any country show an opportunity for growth?
- How would the revenue be affected if we would only offer individual tracks (instead of whole albums)?
